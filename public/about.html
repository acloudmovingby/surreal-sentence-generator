        <h2>What does this site do?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          This site generates random sentences of two types:
          <em>surreal</em> and <em>normal</em>.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Surreal sentences are logically impossible sentences; the words in the
          sentence, according to their typical definition, don't make sense
          together (e.g. "The pizza giggled out loud."")
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Normal sentences, of course, are the opposite. They (theoretically)
          make sense.
        </p>
        <h2>"Language" stuff is weird. Talk math to me.</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Sure! Each word in the sentence is like a node in a graph. The node's
          outgoing edges connect to other words that are logically possible. For
          example, "clever" might point to "doctor" but not to "cheeseburger."
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          To make a normal sentence, you traverse the graph only along those
          edges. To make a surreal sentence, you traverse the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph"
            >complement</a
          >
          of that graph.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          This is just a toy site so the sentences are very simple and the
          vocabulary set is small, but in theory you could build a richer and
          more expressive language generators using similar principles. More
          sophisticated adjustments might mean weighting edges or even adding
          broader context weighting (e.g. if the doctor is "angry", then make
          there should be a higher likelihood of the verb being "yell").
        </p>
        <h2>What did you use to make this?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">I used the following technologies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>UI design in Figma</li>
          <li>Website all in HTML/CSS, no JS</li>
          <li>
            Tested endpoints with Postman (let me know if they don't work!)
          </li>
          <li>Hosted on Heroku</li>
          <li>Words stored in MongoDB backend through Atlas.</li>
